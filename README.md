# Analysis
Lecture notes of the courses "Analysis I + II" at ETHZ (2019-2020)

## The document
FInd it here: [Analysis](./main.pdf). The current status of compilation is:

[![Compile main document](https://github.com/L0rd0fB0red0m/analysis/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/L0rd0fB0red0m/analysis/actions/workflows/main.yml)

You can always compiel it youself by cloning the repo. In order to get working indexes, you'll have to compile twice and populate the index file:
```
texlive ... # do your stuff
makeindex main.idx
texlive ... # do it again
```

## Errata, suggestions, wishes
Use github: create an issue, fix it youself (and please create a pull request!). I'd love to cooperate and improve this document further.
